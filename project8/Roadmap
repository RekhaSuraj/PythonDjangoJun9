Session Management:

Client and server can communicate with some common langauge which is nothing but HTTP.

The basic limitation of HTTP it is stateless protocol. i.e, it is unable to remember client information
for future purpose across multiple request.
Every request to the server is treated as  a new request only.


Why we are using Session ?

To remember client information at server side, some special mechanism must be required
which is nothing but session management mechanisms.

The following are various session management mechanisms.

1.Cookies
2.Session API
3.URL Writing
4.Hidden form fields.


SESSION MANAGEMENT BY USING COOKIES :

What is cookie ?
Cookies is a very small amount of information created by server and maintained by client.


To add cookie to response
    response.set_cookie(cookie_key, cookie_value)

To get cookie send by client:
    request.COOKIES['cookie_key']

    request.COOKIES.get(cookie_name,default_value)   by default set a value.


Summary:
Action		    Who does it?
Set-Cookie	    ✅ Server
Store Cookie	✅ Client (browser)
Send Cookie	    ✅ Client (browser)
Read Cookie	    ✅ Server via request.COOKIES
