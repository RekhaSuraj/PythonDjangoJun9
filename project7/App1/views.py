# from django.views import View
# This imports the base class for Class-Based Views (CBVs).
# You can use it to create your own custom views by subclassing View.
# You need to define your own HTTP methods like get(), post(), etc.

# from django.views.generic import ListView
# ListView is a pre-built generic class-based view for displaying a list of objects from a model.
# It handles querying the database, rendering the template, and passing context â€” all with very little code.
